What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

Interpretations of a theme can also stretch between languages.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

Corona = Crown in spanish, and you're trying to reclaim your throne i.e. your crown. 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

Movement animations like walking. 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

The replay menu doesn't really work and the score/death values are not shown when you win. 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

No.  

Is it clear that every group member participated?

Yes. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

I think it uses a GNU license, so I'm not sure how to interpret it. 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Including controls in the description. 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I enjoyed the music and the direction with the theme. 

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

I thought we had 10 points not 5 so I have to say 0 but on canvas I am putting 2.
