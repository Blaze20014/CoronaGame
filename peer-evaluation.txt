Project: La Corona
Group's repository: 

https://github.com/Blaze20014/CoronaGame

What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

I learned that by flipping the player horizontally it can simulate back and forth movement.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

The game reflects the theme of Corona virus in its name. Even though it is a disease it sounds like a castle.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

I'd like to apply the horizontal switch more in my games. That was something hard for me in my platformer.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

I'd suggest to import the pixels a bit cleaner. Right now the main character sprites look a bit blurry.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

I still have a very difficult time understanding how the raycast system works in Godot.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

Yes, it's clear that every person contributed to this project.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

It doesn't seem that they used the standard MIT license. Whether this is appropriate or not, I'm not sure.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

They could add in more of a backstory to why this man wants to reach the throne.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

The jump control feels very nice and it's very satisfying to jump on the enemies.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
