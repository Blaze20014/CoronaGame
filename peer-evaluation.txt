What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 From this team, I learned that I should use _functionName() format. _function() indicates internal function use only that I often ignore. 
 In a big project like this one, it is useful for other programmers to know what are the interal and external functions are. Great job!

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 Game doesn't seem the reflect the theme of Corona.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 I liked the game's fade out when the player wins. It set the atmosphere.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 The end scene displays the player's data but only shows "%s." This was hardcoded. 
 I patched the end scene so it grabs the Player data correctly from the global scene for data.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 There is a global scene that sets the player data but the same scene has no getter methods to retrieve that data.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 It is not clear every group member participated. The commit history only has commits of a single member.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 The repo has a GNU free software license.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 GitHub markups are recommended for the more professional feel and aesthetics.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

 I love the Castlevania feel the game has. It has a good atmosphere.
