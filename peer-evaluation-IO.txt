What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 Not much because the game didn't work.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 Fo they're game they related to more to crown with a knights and royal theme.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I liked the animations on their assets from what I could  see.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 To get it functioning. I would start the game and it would almost instantly say I died. I would fall through the floor and die. I figured that the reason I was dying was because I fell, but I fixed that so I would fall yet I still died.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 I couldn't quite understand why it wouldn't function.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 It seemed like everyone did their part that they said and it all seemed cohesive, but whoever did the programming must not have reviewed the game. I forked the repository the day the game jam was over so they have improved it now but the fork I have in not functioning.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Maybe just go in depth more about the game itself and the idea behind it.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I like the assets and the music.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
1 because it didn't work.
